## ðŸ“–Overview
This is my portfolio site made with React, Bootstrap and deployed by Firebase. I tried to use some animation libraries and CSS library(Bootstrap) for progressing my skills for React made App.

## ðŸ’»skill I used
HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap, Firebase

## ðŸ“…the purpose of this project
Understanding the usage of Bootstrap and other animation libraries with React.
Reviewing my past projects.

## ðŸ˜¤production period
Around 2-3 weeks(still progressing!).

## ðŸ”¥What I stacked and how solved it.
Layout using Bootstrap didn't show up as I expected. I took the time to lead documentations. But it was a good opportunity for getting documentation leading skill. Enjoying even stacking is one of the great solutions, I think.ðŸ˜Š

## âœ‹What I wont to progress for next project.
Trying more Interactive animations!
