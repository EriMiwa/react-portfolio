Reviewing my past projects.

## ðŸ˜¤production period
Around 2-3 month.(still progressing!)

## ðŸ”¥What I stacked and how solved it.
Layout using Bootstrap didn't show up as I expected. I took a time to lead documentations. But it was a good opportunity for getting documentation leading skill. Enjoying even stacking is one of good solutions, I think.ðŸ˜Š
